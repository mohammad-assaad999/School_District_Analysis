# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Working with Python and its Pandas library on Jupyter is a very effective way for developpers and data analysts to perform analysis and take significant decisions. In this project, I've used the previoulsy mentioned programs in order to help Maria and her supervisor to update the school district analysis because of the evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. That's why I've wanted to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School in the 9th grade with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
## Results
After updating part of the data of Thomas High School, the difference between the school numbers before and after replacing the 9th grade data with NaNs was noticeable. According to the district summary, we can see that the overall passing rate has decreased after the new update on THS school from 65% to 64.9%. As we see in the following two images, there is approximately 30% difference between the data in the schools summary. All the passing grades has sharply decreased that negatively affected the overall passing grade and the rank of the school among the others.

Finally, replacing the ninth-grade scores has not really affected the math and reading scores by grade, spending, size, and type(Not more than 0.5% change) which kept the school among the top five schools based on the overall passing grade.
## Summary
In brief, replacing the ninth-grade scores of the THS school has affected the overall and cumulative passing scores obut not the individual scores. In other words, the overall performance of the school was not affected because of the high grades in the later grades (10th, 11th, and 12th). That's why the changes were on the overall passing scores, the overall passing score of the school (very small change), and the scores by grade, spending, size, and type with a very small percentage.
